# Double-Pendulum-Phase-Portrait
Plots the phase portrait for each angle of a double pendulum
Theta is the angle between the perpendicular to the ground from the base of the first pendulum and the rod of that pendulum; phi is the angle between the perpendicular from the second pendulum to teh ground and that pendulum's rod.
It plots lots of graphs in different colours because I really love colourful graphs.
